## Crack Detection System

This project uses Python's OpenCV library to detect areas of crack and warn the driver about the required speed limit as per the crack percentage.


## Description

* Introductory Page: Page which describes the project
* Login Page: for logging into the website
* Register Page: for registering into the site
* Index Page: this is the main page where we take image input of road ahead
* Output Page: after entering the image on index page, the output that is how much percentage of road is covered with cracks is shown here
* A pre-trained deep learning model using ResNet50 (Convolution Neural Network) is used to predict the cracks in image
* The output shows percentage of crack and warns about the spped limit using this percentage.
