## crack-detection

This project uses Python's OpenCV library to detect areas of crack in a given sample image:

- model.py file contains code for training the model
- The trained model is saved in trained_model.sav
- To detect cracks in a given image run predict.py file in any Python IDE/ terminal with the correct location of image in output_image (line 129)
- The image with crack detection is displayed

- Sample Image:
